# How I Spent 2 Years Not Writing a Blog

Many people say they want to write a blog — to share ideas, build consistency, improve their writing. I am one of those people.

And like many people, I spent *a long time doing everything except writing*.

## 1) Tried Every Editor and Format

- Word
- Google Docs
- LaTeX
- MacDown
- VS Code
- UpNote
- Scribl
- Wordpress
- Ghost

Question I asked myself: *Why not try them all?*  
Choice paralysis: upgraded. 😄

## 2) Tried Every Hosting Setup

Static site generators:

- Hugo  
- Jekyll  
- 11ty  
- Gatsby  
- Astro  
- Ghost  
- GitHub Pages  
- Vercel

I configured, reconfigured, copied, broke, rewrote, and repeated. Revisionism disguised as "getting ready to write."

## 3) Then Didn’t Write Because…

- I didn’t have enough time  
- It felt uncomfortable  
- *Who am I to write about this?*  
- It wouldn’t be good enough  
- I still needed to fix the tech first  
- Basically, it felt uncomfortable — and that was enough

## 4) What Actually Helped

My process now is simple:

- Use the simplest possible tech — GitHub Pages with a basic Jekyll setup  
- Set a timer  
- Start writing  
- When time’s up, stop and publish

That’s it.
