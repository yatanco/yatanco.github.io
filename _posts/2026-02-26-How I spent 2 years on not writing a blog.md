## How I spent 2 years on not writing a blog

Many people say hey I want to write a blog, I want to share my content, I want to improve my writing.
I am one of those people. I am also technical. So I spent countless hours doing everything except writing.
What are all the things you can do you ask?

1) Pick a writing editor and format
- Word, Google Docs, LatEx, MacDown, Visual Code, UpNote, Scribl, Wordpress, Ghost
There are so many, why not try them all?
- Markdown or not? If markdown then which flavor of markdown?
- Which editor can i use to write markdown (you could just use any text editor)

2) Pick and play around with a bunch of ways to host your (non existent) writing
Static Site generators
- Hugo
- Jekyll
- 11ty
- Astro.dev
- Gatsby
CMS / Hosting
- Ghost
- Wordpress
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel

3) Configure, reconfigure, copy etc
- Set up a Hugo on your computer
- Set up Hugo on vercel
- Configure a Theme on Hugo
- Configure the visuals, configure search
- Configure 11ty on your computer 
- Configure 11ty on verce
- Launch, write github actions
- Break and rewrite github actions 
- Break the theme on your computer or online because something you changed or randomly

4) Don't write because
- You dont have enough time now
- It feels uncomfortable 
- Who am I to write about this topic
- This feels like too much, its not going to be good enough
- gotta fix the tech first (see points 1-3)
- Basically it feels uncomfortable and this is enough of a reason not to write

5) How to fix this
My process honestly is just starting, this is the first post I am writing, I have a a timer I am seing the countdown on next to me and have a had a long conversation with chatgpt on this.
The best advice: keep the tech mega simple, in my case github pages with very basic jekyll so I dont have to do anything except write and write the title and date on top, if im feeling generous a little summary.
I put the timer on and start writing. Once the timer is done or i feel like stopping, I stop and push it to github.
